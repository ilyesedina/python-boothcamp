# Welcome to this coding challenge repository!

The projects follow a [UDEMY course curriculum](http://udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) for learning Python.

The projects are split into days, each day focusing on a specific topic or concept in Python programming.

The first 14 days are beginner-friendly.  
Days 15 to 31 are intermediate level.  
Days 32 to 58 are intermediate+ level.  
Days 59 to 81 are advanced level.  
Days 82 to 100 are professional level.
